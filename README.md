# Stock Price Estimator Application

This application challenges users to estimate which of two randomly chosen stocks has a higher value based on stock prices from August 9th. The user scores points for correct guesses and loses all points for incorrect guesses. 

## Features ‚ú®

- **Random Stock Pairing**: Displays two random stocks from two separate lists.
- **User Input**: Allows users to choose which stock they think has a higher value.
- **Scoring System**: Keeps track of the user's score based on their correct guesses.
- **Replay Option**: Provides an option to run the estimator application again.

## Python Concepts Covered üêç

- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Control Statements (If-Else)
- Loops (While Loop)
- User Input Handling
- Recursion

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Stock Selection**: Randomly selects two stocks from the predefined lists `stock_prices_a` and `stock_prices_b`.
2. **User Interaction**: Prompts the user to choose which stock has a higher value.
3. **Score Calculation**: Compares the values of the selected stocks and updates the score based on the user‚Äôs choice.
4. **Replay Option**: Asks the user if they want to play again or exit the application.

## Example Usage üìã

```python
Stock A: YUM! BRANDS, INC (NYSE: YUM)

Stock B: JP MORGAN CHASE & CO (NYSE: JPM)

What stock do you estimate is higher? Select A or B: b

Good Choice! You chose JP MORGAN CHASE & CO (NYSE: JPM) which has a higher valuation at $205.8 compared to YUM! BRANDS, INC (NYSE: YUM) which has a lower valuation at $136.79

Your score is: 1

Would you like to run this estimator application again? Y or N: n
